## Quick Start

### Web Interface
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Enter target host/IP address
3. Configure port range and scan options
4. Click "Start Scan" to begin analysis
5. View results in real-time and export when complete

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Basic scan
python scanner.py google.com

# Custom port range
python scanner.py 192.168.1.1 1 1000

# Scan specific ports
python scanner.py example.com 80 443
```

## Configuration Options

### Scan Types
- **TCP Scan**: Traditional TCP connect scanning
- **UDP Scan**: UDP service detection with intelligent probes
- **SSL/TLS Detection**: Certificate analysis for encrypted services

### Performance Settings
- **Timeout**: Connection timeout in milliseconds (100-10000ms)
- **Concurrent Scans**: Number of simultaneous connections (1-200)
- **Port Range**: Flexible port specification (individual ports or ranges)

### Quick Presets
- **Common Ports**: Standard service ports (1-1000)
- **All Ports**: Complete port range (1-65535)
- **Web Services**: HTTP/HTTPS and related ports
- **Database Ports**: Common database service ports

## Security Features

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Standard services with good security practices
- **Medium Risk**: Services requiring careful configuration
